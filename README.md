## Introduction

Fully remote non-profits face unique cybersecurity challenges: distributed staff, limited budgets, and the need to safeguard donor information, financial data, and internal communications. This guide empowers you to build a strong security foundation using only open-source, free-to-use tools, ensuring cost-effective, transparent, and community-vetted solutions.


## Guiding Principles

- **Risk-Based Focus:** Identify and protect your most sensitive assets first.  
- **Simplicity & Accessibility:** Choose widely supported, user-friendly tools.  
- **Scalability & Flexibility:** Implement solutions that evolve with your organization.  
- **Transparency & Trust:** Use open-source tools for verifiable security and community support.  
- **Continuous Improvement:** Reassess and refine security measures regularly.


## Foundational Concepts

### Zero-Trust Security

Adopt a mindset where no user, device, or network is implicitly trusted. Every request to access sensitive resources should be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted.

### Open-Source First

Open-source tools provide transparency, community-driven development, and lower costs. By using open-source software, you can:

- Verify security through public code reviews.  
- Avoid vendor lock-in.  
- Benefit from large, active communities that provide ongoing support and improvements.


## Architecture Overview

A secure remote environment for your non-profit can be built with these core components:

### VPN and Secure Remote Access

- **WireGuard or OpenVPN:** These open-source VPNs create encrypted tunnels for staff to securely access internal resources over public networks.

### Cloud and On-Premise Hosting Considerations

You can host services on open-source-friendly cloud providers (or on-premise if feasible):

- Consider reputable providers that offer virtual machines (Linux-based) for hosting your chosen open-source tools.
- Always encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Centralize identity control and authentication:

- **Keycloak** or **FreeIPA:** Open-source IAM solutions that support Single Sign-On (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### Network Segmentation

Divide your network into zones to limit the impact of a breach:

- Use firewalls and VLANs to separate public-facing services from internal resources and sensitive data stores.

### Encrypted Communication

Ensure all communication channels are encrypted end-to-end where possible:

- **SimpleXChat:** Secure messaging, voice, and video.  
- **OpenPGP:** Standard for email encryption.
